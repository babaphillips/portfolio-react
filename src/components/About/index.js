          Hello there! My name is Amanda Philips, and I am thrilled to be in the
          beginning phase of my career as a full stack web developer. I am a
          problem solver who is very passionate about my work. I enjoy being on
          a team that explores endless possibilities and pushes to innovate
          creatively. Recently earned a certificate from University of Richmond
          where I developed skills in HTML, CSS, Git, Bootstrap, Javascript,
          jQuery, AJAX, React, APIs, the DOM, JSON, Node, ES6, OOP, Express,
          MySQL, MVC Paradigm, Sequelize, Testing, PWA, MongoDB, NoSQL, and
          React.
